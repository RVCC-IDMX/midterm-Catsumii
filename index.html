                <h3>Originally known as her senioritis bunny stickers, my sister had changed the name to Lazy Bun Stickers as she graduated from college a few 
                    years ago. Many customers relate to these stickers and are super adorable to have on your laptops. These quotes can be deemed as "motivational",
                    as many can relate to the messages being displayed on the stickers. </h3>

                <h3>Earrings are most likely the star of all her products. wingBunny has many inspirators when it comes to making her earrings. As an OG fan of the famous 
                    KPOP group, BTS, my sister created these really pretty earrings inspired by one of the group's song, "Yet to Come". Similar to the song, these earrings 
                    show a similar vibe to the melody; beautiful and soft.
